## Objective and Research Goals

We have access to customer data on loan repayment, such as marital status, income level, age, loan purpose, etc. Our goal is to identify criteria by which we can assess the reliability of borrowers.

## Conclusion

- No clear dependency was found between income level and loan repayment based on the analyzed indicators.
- The presence or absence of children, rather than their quantity, affects loan repayment.
- Successful loan repayment is influenced by the purpose of the loan and the borrower's marital status.

The ideal borrower is a widower without children, with above-average income, and taking a loan for real estate.
